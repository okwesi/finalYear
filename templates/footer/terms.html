                    Rights and Ownership</h1>
                <p id="ccfa" >
                    You retain your rights to any content you submit, post or display on or through the Services.
                    <br><br>Unless otherwise agreed in writing, by submitting, posting, or displaying content on or
                    through the Services, you grant okwesi a nonexclusive, royalty-free, worldwide, fully paid, and
                    sublicensable license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works
                    from, distribute, publicly perform and display your content and any name, username or likeness
                    provided in connection with your content in all media formats and distribution methods now known or
                    later developed on the Services.</p>
                <p id="9c5d" >
                    okwesi needs this license because you own your content and okwesi therefore can’t display it across
                    its various surfaces (i.e., mobile, web) without your permission.</p>
                <p id="44ef" >
                    This type of license also is needed to distribute your content across our Services. For example, you
                    post a story on okwesi. It is reproduced as versions on both our website and app, and distributed to
                    multiple places within okwesi, such as the homepage or reading lists. A modification might be that
                    we show a snippet of your work (and not the full post) in a preview, with attribution to you. A
                    derivative work might be a list of top authors or quotes on okwesi that uses portions of your
                    content, again with full attribution. This license applies to our Services only, and does not grant
                    us any permissions outside of our Services.</p>
                <p id="920c" >
                    So long as you comply with these Terms, okwesi gives you a limited, personal, non-exclusive, and
                    non-assignable license to access and use our Services.</p>
                <p id="9702" >
                    The Services are protected by copyright, trademark, and other US and foreign laws. These Terms don’t
                    grant you any right, title or interest in the Services, other users’ content on the Services, or
                    okwesi trademarks, logos or other brand features.</p>
                <p id="02fc" >
                    Separate and apart from the content you submit, post or display on our Services, we welcome
                    feedback, including any comments, ideas and suggestions you have about our Services. We may use this
                    feedback for any purpose, in our sole discretion, without any obligation to you. We may treat
                    feedback as nonconfidential.</p>
                <p id="c390" >
                    We may stop providing the Services or any of its features within our sole discretion. We also retain
                    the right to create limits on use and storage and may remove or limit content distribution on the
                    Services.</p>

                    Termination</h1>
                <p id="56b4" >
                    You’re free to stop using our Services at any time. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate
                    your access to the Services with or without notice.</p>
                <h1 id="36c8" >
                    Transfer and Processing Data</h1>
                <p id="8151" >
                    In order for us to provide our Services, you agree that we may process, transfer and store
                    information about you in the US and other countries, where you may not have the same rights and
                    protections as you do under local law.</p>
                <h1 id="66c3" >
                    Indemnification</h1>
                <p id="9877" >
                    To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you will indemnify, defend and hold harmless
                    okwesi, and our officers, directors, agents, partners and employees (individually and collectively,
                    the <em class="im">“okwesi Parties”</em>) from and against any losses, liabilities, claims, demands,
                    damages, expenses or costs (<em class="im">“Claims”</em>) arising out of or related to your
                    violation, misappropriation or infringement of any rights of another (including intellectual
                    property rights or privacy rights) or your violation of the law. You agree to promptly notify okwesi
                    Parties of any third-party Claims, cooperate with okwesi Parties in defending such Claims and pay
                    all fees, costs and expenses associated with defending such Claims (including attorneys’ fees). You
                    also agree that the okwesi Parties will have control of the defense or settlement, at okwesi’s sole
                    option, of any third-party Claims.</p>

                    okwesi, you agree to contact us and attempt to resolve the claim informally by sending a written
                    notice of your claim by email at legal@okwesi.com or by certified mail addressed to A okwesi
                    Corporation, P.O. Box 602, San Francisco, CA 94104. The notice must (a) include your name, residence
                    address, email address, and telephone number; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim; and
                    (c) set forth the specific relief sought. Our notice to you will be sent to the email address
                    associated with your online account and will contain the information described above. If we can’t

                        No class or representative actions or arbitrations are allowed under this arbitration provision.

                    submitted to JAMS will be resolved through confidential, binding arbitration before one arbitrator.
                    Arbitration proceedings will be held in San Francisco, California unless you’re a consumer, in which
                    case you may elect to hold the arbitration in your county of residence. For purposes of this section

                    limited by the FAA, these Terms and the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to
                    make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any Dispute and to grant any remedy that
                    would otherwise be available in court, including the power to determine the question of
                    arbitrability. The arbitrator may conduct only an individual arbitration and may not consolidate
                    more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or
                    preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.</p>

                    (d) The arbitration will allow for the discovery or exchange of non-privileged information relevant

                    proceedings, judgments and awards, including information gathered, prepared and presented for
                    purposes of the arbitration or related to the Dispute(s) therein. The arbitrator will have the
                    authority to make appropriate rulings to safeguard confidentiality, unless the law provides to the
                    contrary. The duty of confidentiality doesn’t apply to the extent that disclosure is necessary to
                    prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, in connection with a court application
                    for a preliminary remedy, or in connection with a judicial challenge to an arbitration award or its
                    enforcement, or to the extent that disclosure is otherwise required by law or judicial decision.</p>

                    any arbitration initiated by okwesi, okwesi will pay all JAMS fees and costs. You and okwesi agree
                    that the state or federal courts of the State of California and the United States sitting in San

                    shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration. Further, if any part of
                    this section is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, that
                    provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration,
